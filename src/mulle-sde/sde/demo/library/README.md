# <|PROJECT_NAME|>

#### ðŸ™„ <|PROJECT_NAME|> does something

It works, sometimes.


## Build

This is a [mulle-sde](https://mulle-sde.github.io/) project.

It comes with its own virtual environment and list of dependencies.

Add it to your mulle-sde project with:

```
mulle-sde dependency add --<|PROJECT_DIALECT|> --github "<|GITHUB_USER|>" "<|PROJECT_NAME|>"
```

You can also gather the dependencies manually and use **cmake** to build
the library, or simpler use `mulle-sde craft` to that for you.
