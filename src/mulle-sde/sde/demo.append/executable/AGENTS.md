## Executable

This project produces an executable product.
To run it, use the following command:

```bash
mulle-sde run
```

If you have multiple executables built, use

``` bash
mulle-sde run <productname>
```

You can get a list of products after crafting with

``` bash
mulle-sde product list
```
