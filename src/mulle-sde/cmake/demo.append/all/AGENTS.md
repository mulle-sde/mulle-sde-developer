## CMake Guidelines

This section outlines the structure and conventions for CMake in this
project. Following these guidelines ensures a stable and predictable build.

### 1. File and Directory Roles

#### `CMakeLists.txt` (Project Root)

* **Purpose:** Main entry point for the CMake build process.
* **Guidelines:** Edit for high-level project settings. Use `mulle-sde` to manage
  source files (e.g., `mulle-sde add src/foo.m`).

#### `cmake/reflect/`

* **Purpose:** Auto-generated files by `mulle-sde reflect` to map the sourcetree
  into CMake-readable lists.
* **Guidelines:** **Do not edit**. Changes will be overwritten by `mulle-sde reflect`.

#### `cmake/share/`

* **Purpose:** Contains standard shared CMake modules.
* **Guidelines:** **Do not edit**. Changes will be overwritten by `mulle-sde upgrade`.

#### `cmake/`

* **Purpose:** Project-specific customizations for the build system.
* **Guidelines:** Copy and edit files from `cmake/share/` to override default modules.

| Path             | Editable? | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Yes       | High-level project settings.                                 |
| `cmake/`         | Yes       | Override modules by copying from `cmake/share/`.             |
| `cmake/share/`   | No        | Managed by `mulle-sde upgrade`. Changes will be lost.        |
| `cmake/reflect/` | No        | Auto-generated by `mulle-sde reflect`. Changes will be lost. |
