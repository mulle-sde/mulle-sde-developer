## CMake Guidelines

Changes to the build system must be done with `mulle-sde`. Only edit CMake
files as a  _very_ last resort and under user guidance.

| `CMakeLists.txt` | Yes       | High-level project settings.                                 |
| `cmake/`         | Yes       | Override modules by copying from `cmake/share/`.             |
| `cmake/share/`   | No        | Managed by `mulle-sde upgrade`. Changes will be lost.        |
| `cmake/reflect/` | No        | Auto-generated by `mulle-sde reflect`. Changes will be lost. |
