# DO NOT EDIT THIS FOLDER

Files changes will be lost with the next `mulle-sde reflect` execution.

If you want to make changes, make them in `../generic/include.h` or wherever
convenient.

You can turn off the production of individual headers, comments in the
header will tell you how.  If you don't need any of the headers you can
turn off their production (by **mulle-sde reflect**) with:

```bash
mulle-sde environment set MULLE_SOURCETREE_TO_C_RUN NO
mulle-sde environment set MULLE_MATCH_TO_C_RUN NO
```
