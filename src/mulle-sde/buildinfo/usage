Used by the command `dependency definition` to set up a subproject to
hold the build settings for a dependency. This somewhat complicated setup
allows other projects to inherit your settings.

See: `mulle-sde dependency defintion help` for more help on this topic.

Define the environment variable ONESHOT_NAME for properly named extension
file names and file contents. `extension pimp` will do this for you:

   mulle-sde extension pimp --oneshot-name "foo" mulle-sde/buildinfo
