# The share folder 

It's what gets installed into `.mulle-sde/share`. Your contents clobber whatever is there.

The `bin` folder is for *callbacks*.
The `libexec` folder is for *tasks*.
The `ignore.d` and `match.d` folders are for *patternfiles*.
The `version` folder is the only one required. It is used to identify the version of your installed extension.
