# project folder

The project folder subfolders provide essential project files for each project 
type, like "library" or "executable"

Project files are usually installed once and not upgraded. Project files are 
files, that all users would want to have, in contrast with demo files.

Project files may be reinstalled on user request during an `upgrade`.
