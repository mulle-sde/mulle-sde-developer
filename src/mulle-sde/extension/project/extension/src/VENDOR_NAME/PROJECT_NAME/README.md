# demo folder

The demo folder provides demo files, that are nice when starting out with
a new language and bothersome when you're familiar with it.

Only subfolders are copied. The name of the subfolder is the <type> of 
the project. (e.g. library). The [extension](extension) is just an example, 
you will probably want to delete it.

Demo files are only installed during `init`, never on an `upgrade`.
